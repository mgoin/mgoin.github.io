<p>
Hello! My name is Michael Goin and I'm a senior at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and writing data-oriented code.
</p>
<p>
I'm working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at <a href="http://neuromorphic.eecs.utk.edu/">TENNLab</a>, a Neuromorphic Computing Research team at UTK. Previously, I did some work on <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11837-017-2264-3.pdf">3D printed metal microstructure control</a> at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
</p>
<p>
Some interests outside of work are: showing movies at Cinema Club, cooking, and studying game design.
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to get in contact with me, my <a href="mailto:mgoin@vols.utk.edu">email</a> is the best way to do that.
